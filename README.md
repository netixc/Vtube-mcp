## ⭐️ What is this project?


**Open-LLM-VTuber** is a unique **voice-interactive AI companion** that not only supports **real-time voice conversations**  and **visual perception** but also features a lively **Live2D avatar**. All functionalities can run completely offline on your computer!

You can treat it as your personal AI companion — whether you want a `virtual girlfriend`, `boyfriend`, `cute pet`, or any other character, it can meet your expectations. The project fully supports `Windows`, `macOS`, and `Linux`, and offers two usage modes: web version and desktop client (with special support for **transparent background desktop pet mode**, allowing the AI companion to accompany you anywhere on your screen).

Although the long-term memory feature is temporarily removed (coming back soon), thanks to the persistent storage of chat logs, you can always continue your previous unfinished conversations without losing any precious interactive moments.

In terms of backend support, we have integrated a rich variety of LLM inference, text-to-speech, and speech recognition solutions. If you want to customize your AI companion, you can refer to the [Character Customization Guide](https://open-llm-vtuber.github.io/docs/user-guide/live2d) to customize your AI companion's appearance and persona.

The reason it's called `Open-LLM-Vtuber` instead of `Open-LLM-Companion` or `Open-LLM-Waifu` is because the project's initial development goal was to use open-source solutions that can run offline on platforms other than Windows to recreate the closed-source AI Vtuber `neuro-sama`.

This project underwent code refactoring after version `v1.0.0` and is currently in active development, with many exciting features coming soon! 🚀 Check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/t41372/projects/1/views/5) to learn about update plans.

- 🔧 **Highly customizable**:
  - ⚙️ **Simple module configuration**: Switch various functional modules through simple configuration file modifications, without delving into the code
  - 🎨 **Character customization**: Import custom Live2D models to give your AI companion a unique appearance. Shape your AI companion's persona by modifying the Prompt. Perform voice cloning to give your AI companion the voice you desire
  - 🧩 **Flexible Agent implementation**: Inherit and implement the Agent interface to integrate any Agent architecture, such as HumeAI EVI, OpenAI Her, Mem0, etc.
  - 🔌 **Good extensibility**: Modular design allows you to easily add your own LLM, ASR, TTS, and other module implementations, extending new features at any time

## 😢 Uninstall  
Most files, including Python dependencies and models, are stored in the project folder.

However, models downloaded via ModelScope or Hugging Face may also be in `MODELSCOPE_CACHE` or `HF_HOME`. While we aim to keep them in the project's `models` directory, it's good to double-check.  

Review the installation guide for any extra tools you no longer need, such as `uv`, `ffmpeg`, or `deeplx`.
